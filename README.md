# Metro-Muse

This is a repository for my project, Metro Muse. 
For review purposes, please use the desktop version as it is the most up to date and has all the functionality I have created so far.

In order to run desktop version, have PyQt installed.
If you cannot see map, I have uploaded reference map with all initial data as an html, "MyMap.html".

**Abstract**:
  Information about local music and musicians in NYC is hard to come across. Often times this information is only brought to a persons attention through a social media post, or they just happen to just stumble accross a local musician playing. It is undoubtly not accessable in the same finding a restaurant or a store is. This project tackles that, using Folium to display aggregated data from NYOpenData. The program displays foot traffic data provided by NYOpenData, and displays it as markers and color codes them by density, and has a GUI to let users input their own sightings of local music.
