# Metro-Muse

This is a repository for my project, Metro Muse. 
For review purposes, please use the desktop version as it is the most up to date and has all the functionality I have created so far.

In order to run desktop version, have PyQt installed.
If you cannot see map, I have uploaded reference map with all initial data as an html, "MyMap.html".
