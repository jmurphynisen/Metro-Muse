This is a repository for my project, Metro Muse. 
In order to have current functionality, download main.py, MapClass.py, and master.csv

In order to run desktop version, have PyQt installed.
If you cannot see map, I have uploaded reference map with all initial data as an html, "MyMap.html".

**Abstract**:
  Information about local music and musicians in NYC is hard to come across. Oftentimes this information is only brought to a person's attention through a social media post, or they just happen to just stumble across a local musician playing. It is undoubtedly not accessible in the same way finding a restaurant or a store is. This project tackles that, using Folium to display aggregated data from NYOpenData. The program displays foot traffic data provided by NYOpenData, and displays it as markers and color codes them by density, and has a GUI to let users input their own sightings of local music.
